I would like to thanks the udacity nanodegree in Data Science's team; they have provided me with an excellent set of tools to deal with this project and actually the idea to tackle this is theirs, which has proven to be an excelent way to learn to use Spark. Also a huge clap to those parties collaborating with them which have provided the data we've used.
